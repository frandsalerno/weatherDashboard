# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is a webapp that I've crafted with jQuery, HTML and CSS, making use of the openweathermap, momentjs and ipdata APIs.

The main goal is to allow the user to search for a city to get its weather for today and the next five days.

I've introduced ipdata calls so if the user lands for the first time on the site, it gets its IP and, therefore, its City so I can show their own weather's condition.
